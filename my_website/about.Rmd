# The team

We are a team of young and experienced enological and viticultural consultants with a unique multidisciplinary approach. Our diverse expertise allows us to tackle challenges from multiple perspectives, ensuring tailored solutions. Our journey began in 2017 at the prestigious Edmund Mach Foundation in Italy, where we pursued together our studies in Viticulture and Enology, and we worked together on our shared thesis: the renovation of an abandoned vineyard estate. Since then, our paths diverged, but our commitment to exchanging ideas and refining our craft has kept us united.
