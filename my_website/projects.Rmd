# Maso Levalli - 2017-2020

![](images/maso-01-01.png)

A maso is a typical agricultural structure of the Trentino region in Italy, steeped in history and cultural significance. The Maso Levalli project was initiated to transform a property spanning 3.5 hectares of vineyards and several abandoned buildings into a vibrant, sustainable hub of viticulture and winemaking.

We began by thoroughly characterizing the terrain through morphological, pedological, and climatic analyses. Using this data, along with the rich traditions of the area, we proposed an efficient transition to grape varieties better suited to the environment. Our planning extended to a comprehensive phytopathological defense strategy and meticulous vineyard management practices, ensuring the health and productivity of the land.

To complement the vineyard, we developed detailed winemaking protocols tailored to the anticipated grape yields of each selected variety. These protocols were supported by a functional design for the winery, aimed at optimizing production while respecting the authenticity of the site.

Recognizing the cultural value of the pre-existing buildings, we envisioned their restoration to highlight their historical importance. This included a proposal for their adaptive reuse in alignment with the overall vision for the estate.

Finally, we articulated the mission and vision of Maso Levalli, integrating innovative business activities designed to enhance the area's value and draw visitors. The project was thoroughly documented with image analyses, investment predictions, and a roadmap for implementation, ensuring a balance between preserving heritage and embracing modernity.
